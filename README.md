# ReferendumReader
A utility to read the official Australian Electoral Commmission (AEC) [XML/EML Media Feed v4.3](https://www.aec.gov.au/media/mediafeed/) for a referendum, and do something useful with the data. This is a work in progress. Currently it simply outputs data to the console. I intend to work on this so it is bit more useful in time for the 2023 Voice referendum.

# TODO
- Option to output the data to a Google Sheet
- Support referenda that have multiple questions
- Maybe refactor the whole thing to be a general solution for AEC Media Feeds for elections? idk
